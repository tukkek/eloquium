# Eloquium

Eloquium is a Java Script library that generates both names that sound realistic and fantasy names. It intends to provide an in-between with names that sound generally realistic but that are also different enough from real-life that they can be used as unique names in fiction.

It can also generate fictional names by merging different languages. For example: the included Dwarf language is merged from German and Norwegian.

18 real-world languages are supported, with 8 fantasy languages included.
